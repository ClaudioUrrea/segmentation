Abstract

Background: Intelligent autonomous systems in open-pit mining operations face critical challenges in perception and decision-making due to sensor-based visual degradations, particularly lens soiling and sun glare, which significantly compromise the performance and safety of integrated mining automation systems.

Methods: We propose a comprehensive intelligent framework leveraging single-domain generalization with traditional data augmentation techniques, specifically Photometric Distortion (PD) and Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), integrated within the BiSeNetV1 architecture. Our systematic approach evaluated four state-of-the-art backbones: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2 (Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-based), SegFormer-B0, and Twins-PCPVT-S (ViT-based) within an end-to-end autonomous system architecture. The model was trained on clean images from the AutoMine dataset and tested on degraded visual conditions without requiring architectural modifications or additional training data from target domains.

Results: ResNet-50 demonstrated superior system robustness with mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 84.58% for lens soiling and 80.11% for sun glare scenarios. MobileNetV2 achieved optimal computational efficiency for real-time autonomous systems with 109.58 Frames Per Second (FPS) inference speed while maintaining competitive accuracy (81.54% and 71.65% mIoU respectively). Vision Transformers showed superior stability in system performance but lower overall performance under severe degradations.

Conclusions: The proposed intelligent augmentation-based approach maintains high accuracy while preserving real-time computational efficiency, making it suitable for deployment in autonomous mining vehicle systems. The methodology provides a practical solution for robust perception systems without requiring expensive multi-domain training datasets.

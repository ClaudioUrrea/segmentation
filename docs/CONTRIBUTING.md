Code Style
# Use descriptive variable names
learning_rate = 1e-3  # Good
lr = 1e-3            # Acceptable for short functions

# Document complex functions

    """Calculate domain generalization gap.
    
    Args:
        source_performance: mIoU on source domain
        target_performance: mIoU on target domain
    
    Returns:
        float: Domain gap percentage
    """
    return abs(source_performance - target_performance)
